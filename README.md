# OpenGLBezierProject

This project is a little application of Bezier Curve and Surface, written in C++ with the help of the openGL Library.


## How to use the program
- By pressing C on your keyboard, you can change between a bezier curve with X lines, a bezier curve with lines of Y length and a bezier surface.
- By pressing P you can see the control polynom.
- During the surface scene, you can press on N to see normal as lines or normal as color (interpoled).
- You can also, at any time, press on B to see or not Curve or Surface.
- You can press R to generate random control points.
- Also, for curves you may play with right or left arrow to change parameters as nb of Lines or offSet.
